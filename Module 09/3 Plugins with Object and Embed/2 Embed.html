    The <embed> Element

    The <embed> element is supported in all major browsers.

    The <embed> element also defines an embedded object 
    within an HTML document.

    Web browsers have supported the <embed> element 
    for a long time. However, it has not been a part 
    of the HTML specification before HTML5.

    The <embed> element can also be 
    used to include HTML in HTML:
 -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<embed width="100%" height="500px" src="snippet.html">

</body>
</html>
