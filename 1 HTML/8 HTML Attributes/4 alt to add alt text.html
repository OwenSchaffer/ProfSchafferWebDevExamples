<h2>The alt Attribute</h2>
<p>The alt attribute is used to add alt text to image content, 
    so users who cannot see the image get an 
    understanding of what the image contains.</p>

<!-- Added more explanation here -->
<p>Alt text or alternative text is text attached to images and figures
    so that visually impaired people who use screen readers
    can understand what the image or figure contains.
    Alt text is important to make website accessible.</p>
