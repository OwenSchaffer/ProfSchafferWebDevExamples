    <!-- All HTML5 documents begin with this DOCTYPE declaration -->
    <!-- This declares the document type is HTML -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
    
<!--
    Every HTML document begins with a <!DOCTYPE html> 
    declaration that helps browsers correctly interpret the page.

    <!-- The HTML content itself is contained within <html> tags. -->

        HTML elements can have attributes, 
        which provide additional information about the element.
        Attributes are included in the opening tag.  
        
        In the <html> opening tag above, 
        the lang attribute is set to "en",
        which sets the language of this page to English.

    <!-- Inside the <html> tags, we have the <head> and <body> sections. -->

        <!-- 
            The <head> typically contains meta-information
            about the document, such as its title.
            This info is not visible to the user. 
        -->
        <head>
            <!-- This meta tag sets the character set to UTF-8 -->
            <meta charset="UTF-8" />

            <!-- The <title> shows at the top of the browser tab  -->
            <title>Document</title>
        </head>

        <!-- The <body> contains the content of the page that users see -->
        <body>

            <!-- HTML elements are represented by tags. 
                An HTML tag usually consists of 
                a start tag <p> and end tag </p>, 
                with content in between. 
                Hereâ€™s an example of a paragraph element: 
            -->
            <p>Hello World!</p>

        <!-- This is the closing tag for the <body> element -->
        </body>

    <!-- Closing tag for the <html> element -->
    </html>
    <!-- 
        The <html> and </html> tags wrap or surround all of the content
        in the html document.
