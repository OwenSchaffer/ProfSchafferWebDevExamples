    <!-- Inline styles are only applied to one element at a time -->
    <!-- We add the style attribute 
        and then put the css declarations in the quotes -->
<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
<!-- Notice there is no selector, 
and we don't need a selector because
inline styles only apply to one element -->
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- The style applied to the h1 above does not apply to this h1 element -->
<h1>This is another h1</h1>
