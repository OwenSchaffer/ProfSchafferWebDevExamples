    -CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.

    -CSS describes how HTML elements are to be 
    displayed on screen, paper, or in other media

    -CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the 
    layout of multiple web pages all at once

<head>
    <!-- We can use the <style> tag in the
        head to write CSS in our html file: -->
    <style>

    /* This is a comment in CSS */

    /* CSS comments 
       can be on multiple lines
       just like HTML comments
    */
