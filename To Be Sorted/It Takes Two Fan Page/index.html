        <h2>Here is a short summary of the game It Takes Two written by Google Gemini, an AI chatbot:</h2>

        <p>It Takes Two tells the story of Cody and May, a married couple on the verge of divorce. 
        Their daughter Rose, upset by their conflict, uses a magical book to transform them into dolls trapped 
        in a whimsical world. To break the curse and return to their bodies, they must work together through a 
        series of fantastical challenges designed by the eccentric Dr. Hakim. Their journey forces them to confront
        their problems, rediscover their connection, and learn to collaborate again.</p>
